# v1.7.0 (2024-10-23)
- **Breaking Changes:**
  - _API Change:_ Constructors (`__init__`) and helper functions have been combined for all data classes, leading to breaking changes; if you use `from_*` methods in your existing `pyttb` usage to create instances of data classes this will require changes. see the updated [documentation](https://pyttb.readthedocs.io) and [tutorials](https://pyttb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) for examples of using the update APIs. (https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/pull/213, https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/pull/293)
  - _API Change:_ Changed constructors of main data classes to allow use by external packages that wrap existing data in memory. This allows for use of `pyttb` data classes by external packages without making copies of the data. (https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/pull/182)
  - API Change: `params` output of `cp_als` changed from `tuple` to `dict` (https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/pull/238)
  - _Deprecation:_ Removed unused `end` methods from data classes (https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/pull/195)
- New:
  - Changed support of `numpy` to < version 2 for backwards compatibility; will update in future release (https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/pull/307)
  - Added `gcp_opt` algorithm for Generalized CP decompositions (https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/pull/206)

  - Added `sumtensor` data class (https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/pull/282)
  - Added `sptensor.squash` method (https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/pull/175)
