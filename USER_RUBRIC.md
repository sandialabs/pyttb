# pyttb User Guide and Rubric

The pyttb package is a powerful toolset for working with tensors in Python, designed to cater to a wide range of users, from beginners to advanced. This user guide and rubric will assist new users in understanding the capabilities of the pyttb package and how it can meet their specific needs.

## Installation Guide

For detailed instructions on how to install and set up pyttb, please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.


## User Categories

Users can generally be classified into three main categories:

1. **Novice Users:** Users with no or little previous experience with Python, Matlab, or tensor toolbox. These users might require detailed explanations and step-by-step guidance.

2. **Intermediate Users:** Users with some level of familiarity with Python and Matlab, and a basic understanding of tensor operations. They are likely to be seeking more advanced features and functionalities.

3. **Expert Users:** Users with a strong understanding of Python, Matlab, and tensor operations. They are probably looking for advanced features, custom options, or performance-optimizing/specific functions.

Reference: [Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB](https://www.tensortoolbox.org/index.html)

The Tensor Toolbox provides the classes and functions for manipulating dense, sparse, and structured tensors using MATLAB's object-oriented features. 

- **Tensor Types:** The Tensor Toolbox supports multiple tensor types, including dense, sparse, and symmetric tensors as well as specially structured tensors, such as Tucker format (core tensor plus factor matrices), Krusal format (stored as factor matrices), and sum format (sum of different types of tensors such as sparse plus rank-1 tensor in Kruskal format).
  
- **CP Decompositions:** CP methods such as alternating least squares, direct optimization, and weighted optimization (for missing data). Also alternative decompositions such as Poisson Tensor Factorization via alternating Poisson regression (APR), Generalized CP (GCP) tensor factorization, and symmetric CP tensor factorization. 

- **Tucker Decomposition:** Tucker methods including the higher-order SVD (HOSVD), the sequentially-truncated HOSVD (ST-HOSVD), and the higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI).

- **Eigenproblems:** Methods to solve the tensor eigenproblem including the shifted higher-order power method (SSHOPM) and the adaptive shift version (GEAP). 

- **Working with Tensors:** Creating test problems, tensor multiplication, collapsing and scaling tensors (useful in preprocessing), and more. 

- **Optimization Methods:** Standardized wrappers to make it simple to switch between several different optimization methods, including limited-memory BFGS quasi-Newton method and Adam (stochastic optimization).
