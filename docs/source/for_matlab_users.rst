pyttb for MATLAB users
======================

Already familiar with MATLAB Tensor Toolbox? To assist transitions from the
Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB to pyttb, this guide documents some key differences.

In the ``pyttb`` calling conventions below we'll use the following notation:
    - ``pyttb.<TENSOR_TYPE>``: ``X`` (and ``Y`` for binary operators)
    - ``<SCALAR_TYPE>``: ``a`` for scalars.
