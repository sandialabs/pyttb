    "The idea of GCP is to use alternative objective functions. As such, the most important thing to specify is the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command \n",
    "```\n",
    "M = ttb.gcp_opt(data=X, rank=rank, objective=Objectives.<TYPE>, optimizer=<OPT>)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "computes an estimate of the best rank-|R| generalized CP (GCP) decomposition of the tensor `X` for the specified generalized loss function specified by `<TYPE>` solved with optimizer `<OPT>`. The input `X` can be a tensor or sparse tensor. The result `M` is a Kruskal tensor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predefined objective functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GAUSSIAN`: Gaussian distribution (see also `cp_als` and `cp_opt`)\n",
    "* `BERNOULLI_ODDS`: Bernoulli distribution for binary data\n",

    "* `BETA`: Generalizes exponential family of loss functions.\n",

    "## Solver options\n",
    "Defaults are listed in brackets {}\n",
    "\n",
    "Common options that can be passed to `pyttb.gcp_opt()` include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `init`: Initial solution to the problem {\"random\"}.\n",
    "* `printitn`: Controls verbosity of printing throughout the solve: print every n iterations; 0 for no printing.\n",
    "* `sampler`: Class that defined sampling strategy for stochastic solves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Options\n",
    "In addition to the options above, the behavior of optimizers can be affected by constructing the optimizer with the following optional parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying L-BFGS-B Parameters\n",
    "* `m`: {None}\n",
    "* `factr`: Tolerance on the change on the objective value. Defaults to 1e7, which is multiplied by machine epsilon. {1e7}\n",
    "* `pgtol`: Projected gradient tolerance, defaults to 1e-4 times total tensor size. It can sometimes be useful to increase or decrease `pgtol` depending on the objective function and size of the tensor. {None}\n",
    "* `epsilon`: {None}\n",
    "* `iprint`: {None}\n",

    "### Specifying SGD, Adagrad, and ADAM Parameters\n",
    "There are a number of parameters that can be adjusted for SGD and ADAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochastic Gradient\n",
    "There are three different sampling methods for computing the stochastic gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uniform - Entries are selected uniformly at random. Default for dense tensors.\n",
    "* Stratified - Zeros and nonzeros are sampled separately, which is recommended for sparse tensors. Default for sparse tensors.\n",
    "* Semi-Stratified - Modification to stratified sampling that avoids rejection sampling for better efficiency at the cost of potentially higher variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The options corresponding to these are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `gradient_sampler`: Type of sampling to use for stochastic gradient. Specified by setting `pyttb.gcp.samplers.<SAMPLER>`. Predefined options for `<SAMPLER>` are:\n",
    "    * `Samplers.UNIFORM`: default for dense.\n",
    "    * `Samplers.STRATIFIED`: default for sparse.\n",
    "    * `Samplers.SEMISTRATIFIED`\n",
    "* `gradient_samples`: The number of samples for stochastic gradient can be specified as either an `int` or a `StratifiedCount` object. This should generally be *O(sum(size(X))R)*, where *R* is the target rank. For the uniform sampler, only an `int` can be provided. For the stratified or semi-stratified sampler, this can be two numbers `a, b` provided as arguments to a `pyttb.gcp.samplers.StratifiedCount(a, b)` object. The first `a` is the number of nonzero samples and the second `b` is the number of zero samples. If only one number is specified, then this is used as the number for both nonzeros and zeros, and the total number of samples is 2x what is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimating the Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use sampling to estimate the function value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `function_sampler`: This can be any of the three samplers specified above or a custom function handle. The custom function handle is primarily useful in reusing the same sampled elements across different tests.\n",
    "* `function_samples`: Number of samples to estimate function. As before, the number of samples for estimating the function can be specified as either an `int` or a `StratifiedCount` object. This should generally be somewhat large since we want this sample to generate a reliable estimate of the true function value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the sampler takes two additional options:\n",
    "* `max_iters`: Maximum number of iterations to normalize number of samples. {1000}\n",
    "* `over_sample_rate`: Ratio of extra samples to take to account for bad draws. {1.1}\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some other options that are needed for SGD: the learning rate and a decrease schedule. Our schedule is very simple - we decrease the rate if there is no improvement in the approximate function value after an epoch. After a specified number of decreases (`max_fails`), we quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rate`: Rate of descent, proportional to step size. {1e-3}\n",
    "* `decay`: How much to decrease step size on failed epochs. {0.1}\n",
    "* `max_fails`: How many failed epochs before terminating the solve. {1}\n",
    "* `epoch_iters`:  Number of steps to take per epoch. {1000}\n",
    "* `f_est_tol`: Tolerance for function estimate changes to terminate solve. {-inf}\n",
    "* `max_iters`: Maximum number of epochs. {1000}\n",
    "* `printitn`: Controls verbosity of information during solve. {1}\n",
    "\n",

    "* `beta_1`: Adam-specific momentum parameter beta_1. {0.9}\n",
    "* `beta_2`: Adam-specific momentum parameter beta_2. {0.999}\n",
